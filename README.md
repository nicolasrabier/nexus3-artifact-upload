## Installation
Our goal was to make installation as easy as possible: you need to *host* the *index.html* file on your Nexus 3 installation in a raw repository, that has public access. Yes, that is all.

#### Example:
- Consider having your Nexus 3 running at `https://nexus.mycompany.com/nexus` and a *raw* repository identified as `utils`
- Go to the Administration panel, select Repositories and under Maven 2 > Layout Policy select Permissive
- Grab the `index.html` and upload it with `curl` (or whatever you like):
  ```bash
  $ curl -u <user>:<password> \
         --upload-file index.html \
         https://nexus.mycompany.com/nexus/repository/utils/uploader
  ```
  Note that user and password should be an account that has write access to the `utils` repository.
- Done


## Usage
Visit `https://nexus.mycompany.com/nexus/repository/utils/uploader` and enjoy the integrated artifact uploader.
You can pick a repository, browse (or drop) a file, fill in the details, and press the upload button.

## Contributing
By all means! If you have a fix or an improvement, pull requests are welcome. We are also happy to get any feedback.

## Known issues
- This is really a basic implementation, some useful features are missing. You can upload files with Maven's GAV style, or do raw uploads to any other repository (in this case you need to know the proper URL).
- Input is not validated, it will try to upload with specified settings, and you will have a success, or an error based on what you did.
- You can use the login feature of Nexus, but if you are not logged in, you will be promted for Basic Auth by the browser. That will work for upload, if your setup allows that.
- The JavaScript code uses arrow functions, so it will not work with IE11, but you can experiment with Babel!
